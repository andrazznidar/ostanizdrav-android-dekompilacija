To do so, the identifier is sent to Google. In this process, data may be transferred to the U.S. or other third countries, where the level of data privacy may not correspond to European law and you may not be able to enforce your European rights to data privacy. In particular, security services in the third country could access and analyze the data with Google, even if there is no grounds for suspicion, and link this data with other information, for example. This only involves the identifier that is sent to Google. Google does not receive the information from your error report, however, Google may be able to determine your identity based on the identifier and track that the authenticity check was performed on your smartphone.</string>

Error reports will only be used for troubleshooting and error correction within the framework of future app updates. Only technical support employees can access error reports. Error reports contain a variety of status messages and events that are triggered in the app, but do not contain any information that would enable the NIJZ to determine your identity. Only if you name the error report ID in connection with further messages can a connection be made between the message (and your name contained there, for example) and the information contained in the error report (such as technical messages for calculation as part of exposure logging, information displayed and steps performed in the app, and, where applicable, a retrieved test result and random IDs shared as part of notifying others).</string>

The changes will not affect how you use the app. If you continue to use the app or reopen it, we will assume that you agree to the updated terms of use."</string>
    <string name="interoperability_onboarding_delta_footerDescription">"You do not need to change anything to find out whether you have had possible exposures involving app users in the participating countries and are therefore at risk of infection yourself. You just need to make sure that the exposure logging feature is still enabled. Exposure logging will automatically warn you about any possible exposure involving another user of the #OstaniZdrav or any other official coronavirus-tracing app.

If you have enabled the 'COVID-19 Exposure Notifications' functionality on your smartphone, then your Android smartphone continuously generates random IDs and sends them via Bluetooth so that they can be received by other smartphones near you. Your Android smartphone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your Android smartphone and stored there for 14 days.

For exposure logging, the app downloads up-to-date lists every day of the random IDs of all users who have shared their test result (more precisely: their own random IDs) via their official coronavirus-tracing app in order to warn other users. These lists are then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your Android smartphone.

The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure. In this case, the app gains access to the data recorded by your Android smartphone about the possible exposure (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact). The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance to the other user (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The app analyses this information in order to calculate your risk of infection and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your Android smartphone.

Apart from you, nobody (not even the NIJZ or the health authorities of participating countries) will know whether a possible exposure has been detected and what risk of infection has been identified for you.

The app’s privacy notice (including information about the data processing carried out for the transnational exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under „App Information' > „Data Privacy'."</string>

    <string name="onboarding_tracing_accessibility_title">Onboarding page 3 of 6: How to Enable Exposure Logging</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body">Exposure logging works by your Android smartphone receiving, via Bluetooth, encrypted random IDs of other app users and passing your own random IDs to their smartphones. Exposure logging can be deactivated at any time.</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body_consent">"You need to enable exposure logging to find out whether you have had possible exposures involving app users in the participating countries and are therefore at risk of infection yourself. By tapping on the 'Activate exposure logging' button, you agree to enabling the exposure logging feature and to the associated data processing by the app.

In order to use the exposure logging feature, you will also have to enable the 'COVID-19 Exposure Notifications' functionality provided by Google on your Android smartphone and grant the #OstaniZdrav permission to use this.

Your Android smartphone will then continuously generate random IDs and send them via Bluetooth so that they can be received by other smartphones near you. Your Android smartphone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your Android smartphone and stored there for 14 days.

For exposure logging, the app downloads up-to-date lists every day of the random IDs of all users who have shared their test result (more precisely: their own random IDs) via their official coronavirus-tracing app in order to warn other users. These lists are then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your Android smartphone.

The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure. In this case, the app gains access to the data recorded by your Android smartphone about the possible exposure (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact). The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance to the other user (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The app analyses this information in order to calculate your risk of infection and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your Android smartphone.

Apart from you, nobody (not even the NIJZ or the health authorities of participating countries) will know whether a possible exposure has been detected and what risk of infection has been identified for you.

You can withdraw your consent to the exposure logging feature at any time by either disabling the feature using the toggle switch in the app or deleting the app. If you would like to use the exposure logging feature again, you can toggle the feature back on or reinstall the app. If you disable the exposure logging feature, the app will no longer check for possible exposures. If you also wish to stop your device sending and receiving random IDs, you will need to disable the 'COVID-19 Exposure Notifications' functionality in your Android smartphone’s settings. Please note that the app will not delete your random IDs or those received from other smartphones which have been recorded by this functionality on your Android smartphone. You can only permanently delete these in your Android smartphone settings.

The app’s privacy notice (including information about the data processing carried out for the transnational exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under 'App Information' > 'Data Privacy'."</string>

    <string name="settings_tracing_body_text">"You need to enable the exposure logging feature so that the app can determine whether you are at risk of infection. The exposure logging feature works transnationally, meaning any possible exposure involving users is also detected by other official coronavirus apps.

The exposure logging feature works by your Android smartphone receiving encrypted random IDs from other app users via Bluetooth and passing your own random IDs to their smartphones. Every day, the app downloads lists containing the random IDs – along with any voluntary information about the onset of symptoms – of all users who have tested positive for the virus and voluntarily shared this information (specifically: their random IDs) via their app. This list is then compared with the random IDs of other users you have encountered that have been recorded by your Android smartphone, in order to calculate the likelihood that you have also been infected and to warn you if necessary.

You can use the toggle switch to disable exposure logging at any time.

Personal data, such as your name, address, or location, is never recorded during exposure logging, nor is this information passed on to other users. It is not possible to use random IDs to draw conclusions about individual persons."</string>
