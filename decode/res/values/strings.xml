    <string name="interoperability_onboarding_delta_footerDescription">"You do not need to change anything to find out whether you have had possible exposures involving app users in the participating countries and are therefore at risk of infection yourself. You just need to make sure that the exposure logging feature is still enabled. Exposure logging will automatically warn you about any possible exposure you had with a user of the Corona-Warn-App or any other official coronavirus app.

When COVID-19 Exposure Notifications are enabled, your Android smartphone continuously generates random IDs and sends them via Bluetooth so that they can be received by other smartphones near you. Your Android smartphone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your Android smartphone and stored there for 14 days.

For exposure logging, the app downloads a list, which is updated daily, of the random IDs of all users who have shared their random IDs via their official coronavirus app. This list is then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your smartphone.

The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure. In this case, the app gains access to the data recorded by your smartphone about the possible exposure (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact). The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance to the other user (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The app analyses this information in order to calculate your risk of infection and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your smartphone.

Apart from you, nobody (not even the RKI or the health authorities of participating countries) will know whether a possible exposure has been detected and what risk of infection has been identified for you.

The app’s privacy notice (including information about the data processing carried out for the transnational exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under „App Information“ > „Data Privacy“."</string>

    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body">Exposure logging works by your smartphone receiving, via Bluetooth, encrypted random IDs of other users and passing your own random IDs to their smartphones. Exposure logging can be deactivated at any time.</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body_consent">"You need to enable exposure logging to find out whether you have had possible exposures involving app users in the participating countries and are therefore at risk of infection yourself. By tapping on the “Enable exposure logging” button, you agree to enabling the exposure logging feature and to the associated data processing by the app.

In order to use the exposure logging feature, you will also have to enable the “Exposure Notifications” functionality provided by Google on your smartphone and grant the #OstaniZdrav App permission to use this.

Your smartphone will then continuously generate random IDs and send them via Bluetooth so that they can be received by other smartphones near you. Your smartphone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your smartphone and stored there for 14 days.

For exposure logging, the app downloads up-to-date lists every day of the random IDs of all users who have shared their test result (more precisely: their own random IDs) via their official coronavirus app in order to warn other users. These lists are then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your smartphone.

The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure. In this case, the app gains access to the data recorded by your smartphone about the possible exposure (date, duration and Bluetooth signal strength of the contact). The Bluetooth signal strength is used to derive the physical distance to the other user (the stronger the signal, the smaller the distance). The app analyses this information in order to calculate your risk of infection and to give you recommendations for what to do next. This analysis is only performed locally on your smartphone.

You can withdraw your consent to the exposure logging feature at any time by either disabling the feature using the toggle switch in the app or deleting the app. If you would like to use the exposure logging feature again, you can toggle the feature back on or reinstall the app. If you disable the exposure logging feature, the app will no longer check for possible exposures. If you also wish to stop your device sending and receiving random IDs, you will need to disable the “Exposure Notifications” functionality in your smartphone settings. Please note that the app will not delete your random IDs or those received from other smartphones which have been recorded by this functionality on your iPhone. You can only permanently delete these in your smartphone settings.

The app’s privacy notice (including information about the data processing carried out for the transnational exposure logging feature) can be found in the menu under “App Information” > “Data Privacy”."</string>
    <string name="onboarding_tracing_body_emphasized">The encrypted random IDs only pass information about date, duration, and proximity (calculated from signal strength) to other people.
